# HealthCare.ai

* We strongly believe that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can bring great impact in the Real World in almost all the sectors including Health Care. So, we wanted to show the real world how can this happen. So, we have taken up two sample real world problems in Health Care. One of them is Predicting whether someone has Heart disease or not and other one is for Diabetes. So yeah, this is it for now..Go have a look on the Apps.
