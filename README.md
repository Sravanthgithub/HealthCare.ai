# HealthCare.ai

* We strongly believe that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can bring great impact in the Real World in almost all the sectors including Health Care. So, we wanted to show the real world how can this happen. So, we have taken up two sample real world problems in Health Care. One of them is Predicting whether someone has Heart disease or not and other one is for Diabetes. So yeah, this is it for now..Go have a look on the Apps.

## Link for our App - https://sravanthgithub.github.io/web-page/

## Required dependencies to run our App 
* 1 . Internet
* 2 . Browser
* 3 . No need to install anything.

# Model - 1
## Predicting whether someone has Heart Disease or not with Machine Learning
* Language - `Python`, `HTML`, `CSS`
* Modules used - `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`, `Streamlit`, `Pickle`
* Link - https://heartcare-ai.herokuapp.com
* Info - We trained the model with some powerful machine learning techniques and used the one with highest accuracy. This basically takes some inputs from the user (related to medical diagnosis/reports) and thus the prediction is made.

# Model - 2
## Predicting whether someone has Diabetes or not with Machine Learning
* Language - `Python`, `HTML`, `CSS`
* Modules used - `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`, `Streamlit`, `Pickle`

### This is how the prediction look like
